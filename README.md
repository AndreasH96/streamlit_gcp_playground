# Streamlit gcp playground

This is just me playing around with using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), an open source tool to create interactive webapps through python scripting <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" heigt=20 width=20>. 
The idea here is to able to allow the user to upload either an image or a txt/csv/xls/xlsx file, do some magic with it through GCP and then showing some nice graphics. 

Todo: 
* Pretty much everything
